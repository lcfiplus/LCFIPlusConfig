-- sample steering files
(a) vertex.xml            (1-2), for DST production
(b) jetclustering.xml     (3-4), for non-flavor-tag applications
(c) vertexjet.xml         (1-4), vertex finder + jet clustering
(d) makentuple.xml        (3-6), making training sample from DST
(e) makentuplefrompfo.xml (1-6), vertex finder + (d)
(f) makentuplefromjet.xml (5-6), for tuning MVA variables from samples after (b)/(c)
(g) train.xml             (7), for training using result of (d-f)
(h) flavortag.xml         (3-5,8), for flavor tagging from DST
(i) flavortagfrompfo.xml  (1-5,8), vertex finder + (h)
(j) trackntuple.xml	  (9), for making track probability files

-- easy usage
*** obtaining flavor tag outputs with existing training files
 Just run (h)flavortag.xml with replacing input/output files and training files
 (for samples before vertex finding, run (i) instead)

*** obtaining flavor tag outputs with original training files
 (A) Run (d)makentuple.xml on training samples to use .root files (b-sample/c-sample/q-sample)
     (for samples before vertex finding, run (e) instead)
 (B) Run (g)train.xml with the .root files created in (A)
 (C) Run (h)flavortag.xml with the weight files created in (B)
     (for samples before vertex finding, run (i) instead)

*** making probability files (v3 only)
 The probability files are provided for ILD_o1_v5 geometry.
 We recommend to reproduce the files if you run LCFIPlus in other geometries.
 This should be done before training.
 (A) Run (j)trackntuple.xml on reference samples for creation of root files
  with bb/cc/qq samples (~ 10k events are OK. We use 91 GeV, but maybe OK with other energies)
 (B) Merge all bb, cc, qq root files using hadd etc. respectively. 
 (C) Run macro/TrackProb.C in LCFIPlus with the merged files to obtain two output for d0 and z0 files.
 (D) Use those two files for the "FlavorTag.D0(Z0)ProbFileName" in flavor tagging.
